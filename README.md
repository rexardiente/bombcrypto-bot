# Bomb Crypto Bot

# About:
This is an open-source bot, the code is open for anyone to see, fork and
update.
As the developer, I created this bot just for my personal use, I decided to
publish to help other people and maybe get a few bucks in donation.
I would like to keep this bot free and open source, so as an incentive for me to spend the time and energy maintaining the
bot, I have created some donation milestones so people can collectively fund
the bot..

#### ** Note: ** _Sometimes the bot can't recognize the image to click because it is tested in different screen sizes. It is recommended to use the suggested requirements based on your machine Operating System or you might need to create a new image based on your screen and replace the existing image._
